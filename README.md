Bugfree octo-avenger
====================
Bugfree octo-avenger (_bugfree_ for short) is a simple web app written in AngularJS. It keeps track of competitors end time,
and displays them in a nice way. You can order the results table by first name, last name and
end time.

_"Det blir nice"_ was the words first used to describe this simple app. (Those three
words are, as it turned out, a great way to describe the workflow while using Angular.)

The app largely uses the power in AngularJS templating and the two-way data binding,
which makes sure that the data is allways the same all over the app.

#### Todo
* Make the filter work for the end time.
* Fix the column width so that it doesn't jump around when changing from the podium view.
* Add some sort of session saving, and mayhaps a server backend.
* Fix the [Good Ol' Font bug on Chrome for Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21018037/bad-font-rendering-chrome/21315724#21315724). Or wait until it gets fixed.

## Technical details
It's a very simple web app. It uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com)
using [Less CSS](http://lesscss.org), without any backend. I've tried to apply the KISS principle here.

### The app
The app is a angular module called `bugfree`. The controller `Result` handles the
entries with the functions `addEntry` and `reset`. AddEntry pushes a new entry
to the `entries` array. Reset resets the form.

The filter `prettyTime` displays the object sent to it as a time in the form
`H:MM.SS`, with leading zeroes on the minutes and seconds.

### The entries
Each entry object contains the following data:
* `first_name`
* `last name_name`
* `time` the end time, object. Split up in order to enable it to be ordered correctly.
	* `hh`
	* `mm`
	* `ss`

### The results
The results are displayed using the `ng-repeat`-directive, and are ordered by the
`OrderBy`-filter. The results can be filtered, based on name.

### Folders
The file structure for this repo:
* `css` all the css files!
	* `css/src` all the less files that will be used to compile a static css file
	* `css/bootstrap` all the bootstrap css files
* `fonts` the fonts
* `script` the javascript files
	* `script/libs` the javascript libs used (AngularJS, Less)
